        <h2>Prince Charles Cinema</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="popuptext popup1">
        <p class="popupcontent">Located in the heart of the West End, the Prince Charles Cinema curates programmes that celebrate cult, arthouse, and classic films, alongside recent Hollywood releases. The site itself sprang to life as a Theatre back in 1962 before making the rather interesting shift to becoming a film-house of ill repute. Then in 1991, the early seeds of The Prince Charles Cinema were planted and from there this mighty little cine-behemoth began to grow. Film fanatics especially love their sing-along and quote-along screenings.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="popuptext popup2">
          <p class="popupcontent">The Lexi is a single-screen independent run almost entirely by local volunteers, with every penny of profits going to support a charity in South Africa. The programme is a mix of everything from recent blockbusters to arthouse and foreign films, plus special events, Q&As and classic movie seasons (a recent run of Francois Truffaut oldies were accompanied by cheese and wine tastings). The chairs are comfy, the sound system is second to none and the bar cosy.<p>

        <h2>Phoenix Cinema</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="popuptext popup3">
        <p class="popupcontent">The Phoenix is one of the UK’s oldest purpose-built, continuously operating cinemas. Beneath the vaulted ceiling which dates back to 1910, the history of film has been shared with millions of audience members. From silent films with live music through two world wars when newsreels were the only source of moving images that captured events overseas; from the clicking reels of 24 frames a second to the digital projection of today, the Phoenix has witnessed it all. This single-screen cinema shows the latest independent and foreign films.</p>

        <h2>Ciné Lumière</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="popuptext popup4">
        <p class="popupcontent">Founded in 1998 by Catherine Deneuve to promote the best in French and world cinema, Ciné Lumière offers a good mix of new releases and retrospective seasons. The cinema is located within L’Institut Français du Royaume-Uni in South Kensington. Given its close association with the French government and cultural establishment, the Ciné Lumière regularly plays host to French filmmakers, in town to discuss their work. Films screened are in their original language with English subtitles.</p>

        <h2>Genesis Cinema</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="popuptext popup5">
        <p class="popupcontent">Originally opened as a music hall back in 1848, then as the Paragon Theatre of Varieties hosting acts such as Charlie Chaplin, the venue first functioned as a cinema in 1912 – making it the oldest cinema in east London – and was known as the Mile End Empire. Despite a decade of destitution, during which the cinema was boarded up, the glamorous Genesis Cinema now shows a lively programme of high-end mainstream movies and independent arthouse films.</p>

        <h2>PeckhamPlex</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="popuptext popup6">
        <p class="popupcontent">The Peckhamplex is south London’s most loved cinema. When it was recently threatened with redevelopment, two local advertising creatives even made a fake movie trailer to ‘Save the Plex’. It seems to have done the trick because the Plex lives on to make London moviegoers happy with its rough-and-ready charm and bargain-basement ticket prices. The latest blockbusters show for a mere £4.99 every day of the week, so you can catch 2018 movies at 1998 prices.</p>

          <h2>Rio Cinema</h2>
        </div>
      <div class="popuptext popup7">
        <p class="popupcontent">This Dalston cinema opened as the Kingsland Empire in 1915 (although films were shown on the same site several years before in a converted shop). With a newly added second screen to go with its grand, two-floor auditorium, the Rio shows mostly independent and foreign films, with a healthy sprinkling of double bills, classics and films for kids. The foyer is a compact but welcoming place to find food and drink before a film – although you might want to save yourself for one of Dalston’s Turkish restaurants.</p>

        <h2>Regent Street Cinema</h2>
      </div>
        <div class="popuptext popup8">
          <p class="popupcontent">Built in 1848 and housed within the Polytechnic Institution on London’s Regent Street, the cinema was the first in the country to show moving pictures. In 1896, the cinema showcased the Lumière brothers’ Cinématographe to a paying audience, and, as the curtain fell, British cinema was born. After being used as a student lecture hall by the university since 1980, it was restored into a working cinema featuring a state-of-the-art auditorium as well as an inclusive space for learning, cultural exchange and exhibitions.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="popuptext popup9">
        <p class="popupcontent">More than just a cinema, the Arthouse in Crouch End mixes the world of film, art, live music, theatre, dance, workshops, live streaming, comedy, and anything else that takes their fancy into one community-serving arts venue. Voted London’s best cinema by Time Out readers in 2014, this two-screen independent venue in a former Salvation Army Hall opened its doors in spring 2014 and quickly became a favourite with locals from Crouch End and the surrounding area. Its programme leans towards independent and foreign movies.</p>
